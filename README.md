# Piano Learning

An interactive piano tutor for learning to read and play notes on a real
piano — built around a **KAWAI ES120** (or any class-compliant USB-MIDI
keyboard) plugged straight into your PC. The browser talks to the piano
directly; there's a small Node server for the app itself and for saving
your progress. No cloud, no database — everything is stored locally as
JSON files on your machine.

## How to run

1. Download the project (ZIP via GitHub's "Code → Download ZIP", or
   `git clone` if you're developing) and extract/open it.
2. Plug your piano into the PC via USB.
3. Run the launcher:
   - Windows: double-click `start.ps1` (or run `.\start.ps1` in PowerShell)
   - macOS/Linux: `./start.sh`

   It installs everything it needs on first run and then opens the app in
   your browser automatically. Press `Ctrl+C` in that terminal to stop it.
4. Use **Chrome or Edge** (required — see [Browser support](#browser-support)).
5. In the header, pick your piano from the device dropdown and click
   **Connect**.

## How it works

- **MIDI connection is direct and local.** The frontend uses the
  browser's [Web MIDI API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_MIDI_API)
  to read note-on/note-off events straight from the piano — no backend,
  no driver installation beyond your OS's standard USB-MIDI support.
  This is also why the project doesn't need .NET or any native MIDI
  library: the browser already exposes everything required.
- **Learn (the learning path)** is the main way to use the app — like
  Duolingo, but for piano. The path is split into units, and every unit
  goes through the same steps:
  1. **Meet** — the new notes are shown on the staff and on the keyboard;
     play each one a few times.
  2. **Drill** — flashcards: read a note on the staff and play it. New
     notes are mixed with the ones you already know.
  3. **Read** — play a short melody made from your notes. No metronome;
     the app waits for each note.
  4. **In time** — play a new melody along with a metronome.
  5. **Song** — play a real song that uses exactly those notes.

  You need **80%** on a step to unlock the next one, and you can retry as
  often as you like. Press **Continue** on the Learn page to pick up where
  you left off.
- **The path is planned in phases:** right hand → left hand → both hands →
  left-hand chords → right-hand chords → melody with chords. Phase 1
  (right hand) is playable now; the others are shown as "coming soon".
- **Free practice** is still there for practicing outside the path:
  - **Note Trainer** teaches individual notes with an adaptive schedule —
    the same idea as spaced-repetition language apps (Anki, etc.): notes
    you nail repeatedly get spaced further apart; notes you miss come back
    sooner. The Learn page tells you when notes are due for review.
  - **Sheet Practice** generates a short sight-reading exercise from the
    notes you know and grades pitch and timing against a metronome.
  - **Songs** lists all songs; each unlocks once you know every note it uses.
- Every mode feeds the same per-note progress, so practicing anywhere
  helps everywhere.
- **Stats** shows a keyboard heatmap of your mastery per note, overall
  accuracy, day streak, minutes practiced, and your session history.

### Data & privacy

All practice history lives in `server/data/` — `progress.json` (progress
per note), `sessions.json` (session log) and `path.json` (learning-path
steps you've passed) — and is never sent anywhere except your own local
server. To reset your progress entirely, stop the server and delete those
three files.

## Current state

Implemented and working end-to-end (verified with a scripted browser run
simulating MIDI input — see the project skill for how, since there's no
real piano attached in a dev sandbox):

- MIDI connect/disconnect UI, remembers your last device.
- **Learning path, phase 1 (right hand):** 5 units — C D E (Hot Cross
  Buns), G (Mary Had a Little Lamb), F (Ode to Joy), A (Twinkle Twinkle),
  B and high C (Joy to the World). Meet / Drill / Read / In time / Song
  steps, 80% pass rule, progress saved per step with best score.
- Phases 2–6 (left hand, both hands, chords) are listed on the path as
  "coming soon".
- Note Trainer: adaptive note introduction + SM-2-style spaced repetition,
  round-based practice with live accuracy, session logging.
- Sheet Practice: generated sight-reading from known notes, metronome
  count-in, per-note pitch + timing grading.
- Songs: 5 songs, auto-unlock, adjustable tempo, same grading as Sheet
  Practice.
- Stats: keyboard mastery heatmap, accuracy, streak, minutes practiced,
  session history table (including lesson steps).

Curriculum currently covers **15 white keys, C3–C5**; the learning path
uses the 8 right-hand notes so far. Sheet music is treble-clef only,
which is why the left-hand phase comes next — see the roadmap in the
project skill (`.claude/skills/piano-learning-app/SKILL.md`).

## Browser support

Requires **Chrome or Edge** (or another Chromium-based browser) —
Firefox and Safari don't implement the Web MIDI API. The app detects this
and shows a clear message rather than failing silently.

## Project structure

```
shared/         Note-name/MIDI conversions, SRS scheduler, song library,
                learning path. Used identically by the server and the browser.
server/         Express app: static file serving, JSON-file persistence
                under server/data/ (no database).
public/         Frontend: vanilla JS/CSS, no build step, no framework.
  js/midi.js             Web MIDI wrapper
  js/keyboard.js         On-screen piano keyboard (SVG)
  js/notation.js         Staff notation rendering (VexFlow)
  js/metronome.js        Click track + timing reference
  js/sequence-player.js  Play-along grading used by lessons, sheets, songs
  js/views/              One module per screen (home = learning path,
                         lesson, trainer, sheet, songs, stats)
```

changes here, see `CLAUDE.md` and the project skill
`.claude/skills/piano-learning-app/SKILL.md` — it's written to be loaded
before any development work on this repo (there's also a matching
`piano-dev` subagent preconfigured to load it automatically).
